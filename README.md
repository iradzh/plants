# ðŸŒ¿ 'Plants' Project ðŸŒ¿

Welcome to the Plants Online Shop project! This simple e-commerce web application, developed with HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and SCSS, was a part of my studies at RollingScopes School. It reflects the practical application of skills gained during my academic journey.

## Features Highlights

- Adaptive layout

Ensured an optimal display for screens 1440px or wider. Introduced adaptive layout adjustments for 768px and 380px screens, utilizing JavaScript for a responsive menu below 768px. This adaptive design is essential for a seamless user experience across devices. The addition of a burger menu enhances navigation accessibility.

- Focus in Service Section:

Implemented focus switching on services and applied a blur effect to non-selected service cards. This enhances user engagement and visual clarity within the service offerings.

- Accordion in "Prices" section:

Introduced an accordion effect, implemented three dropdowns for various services and prices, and displayed service descriptions upon clicking the dropdown button. These features provide a streamlined and informative presentation of pricing details, enhancing user understanding and engagement.

- Custom select dropdown in the "Contacts" section:

Within the Contacts Section, a personalized select dropdown was crafted, seamlessly integrating a city-select dropdown. The result is a user-friendly experience, as office addresses and phone numbers dynamically adjust based on the user's city selection. This thoughtful design streamlines navigation, ensuring users easily access pertinent contact information.
